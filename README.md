#theOdinProject odin-recipes

- Get used to and adept with Git/GitHub
- Improve knowledge and coding with HTML

## Purpose

Create an HTML site that contains recipes

### Completion
I have completed the project; however, it isn't rendering upon publication as it does in VSCode or as expected. The Main page is called index.html. I have also noticed that there are differences when viewing the project in Chrome and Safari.
